					<li>Make a little change.</li>
					<li>Run all tests and see them all succeed.</li>

				<b>How about these?
				<ul>
					<li>Quickly add a test.</li>
					<li>Take a break or review the code.</li>
					<li>IDE tells me that there is new test fail.</li>
					<li>Make a little change.</li>
					<li>Take a break or review the code.</li>
					<li>IDE tells me all tests succeed.</li>
					<li>Refactor to remove duplication.</li>
					<li>Take a drink of coffee and IDE tells me there is no broken test.</li>
				</ul></b>

				<p>It's great that we have time to run all tests continuously. But more tests we wrote, more time costs.
				It was too much cost for me to run all tests in almost every real project before.
				So it's better that I just run tests about which are cared recently continuously and run all tests
				when I finish a task or need to commit code.
				</p>

				<p><b>Fireworks</b> is such a plugin for helping TDDers to have more pleasure in process of test-driven development
				by spending more time on writing code.
				The configuration of "Delay time" is key of when to schedule task of running tests about which are cared
				after document changed and no error.
				It's a normal way to trigger a task after a delay time when there is no action performed by keyboard
				or mouse and all documents have no error marked during period of delay time.
				Yes, it's not good enough. I am still working on powup it. Yuo can read the changes of version to find
				what have been improved.
				</p>

				<p>There is a "recent test list" for collecting test about which are cared. JUnit TestCase will be added into "recent test list"
				when we open or edit it. And there is a regex of test class name for helping us to filter test we don't want to care recently.
				If there is a test failed after we run all tests by pressing hot key, it will be added into "recent test list" too.
